This project is a simple campus event content management system that builds on what I made for the midterm. The final version takes the original idea and turns it into a more complete web app with a real database, user accounts, and full event management. I set up a MySQL database with tables for users, events, categories, organizers, and messages so the whole system can handle real data. I also used PDO everywhere to keep things safe and to prevent SQL injection.

Users can sign up, log in, and manage their own events in a personal dashboard. Admins get extra control and can view and edit everything. The public site lets anyone browse events and send messages through the contact form. The design uses Bootstrap to keep everything clean and responsive. I also added partials so the header and footer stay consistent across all pages.

Overall this project shows how the midterm idea grew into a working CMS with authentication, CRUD features, and a much better structure. It is not perfect but it feels much closer to a real project than the version I started with.
